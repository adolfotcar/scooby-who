NodeJS Dog Breeding Project

NEITHER THE IDEA OR THE NAME WERE MINE! Project developed with Johnathan Flanagan and Neil Fitzgerald.
The idea is to create a safe place to sell and buy dog puppies, obeying the applicable laws in the Republic of Ireland.
My role in this project was the ORM/Model part of the MVC.

A Node environment is pretty much all you need to run it.
